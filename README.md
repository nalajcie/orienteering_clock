# Introduction
This is *work-in-progress* project to build orienteering clock, currently in prototyping phase. I will put more information here when it will be completed.

# Contents
 * `src/` - Arduino prototype source for driving multiplexed LED display and time counting
  It's best to link this folder to your Arduino projects folder, in windows:
    > mklink /D c:\Users\wm\Documents\Arduino\orienteering-clock c:\proj\orienteering_clock\src
 * `schematics/` - EAGLE schematics of prototype parts
  It's best to link this folder to your Eagle library, in windows:
    > mklink /D c:\Users\$USER\Documents\eagle\orieenting-clock C:\proj\orienteering_clock\schematics
 * `doc/` - documentation of parts, etc.
